### 家庭是生产人的性格的工厂（families are factories that produce human personalities）

塔尔科特·帕森斯（Talcott Parsons），一位有影响力的美国社会学家，以其结构功能主义方法理解社会而知名。他将家庭视为塑造个人性格的至关重要的“工厂”，在根据社会规范和期望社会化个体方面扮演着核心角色。这个社会化过程为人们在其未来社会角色中，包括工作场所和其他社会机构中的角色，做好了准备。

帕森斯认为，现代核心家庭结构，即由已婚夫妇及其子女组成、相对独立于其大家庭和社区生活的家庭单元，在20世纪中叶的美国尤其有效。他认为这种家庭形式在社会化成员以满足社会职能方面比大型扩展家庭单位更为高效。

在二战期间，传统的家庭性别角色和社会角色被打破，当许多女性开始承担以前被视为男性专属的工作时，这表明她们完全有能力胜任这些工作。尽管如此，帕森斯和其他非女权主义学者通常坚持基于性别的自然劳动分工观点，其中男性预期是主要的养家糊口者，而女性则主要负责家务和育儿。

帕森斯对家庭作为社会制度的观点深受埃米尔·涂尔干（Émile Durkheim）和马克斯·韦伯（Max Weber）作品的影响。涂尔干关于“机械”和“有机”团结的概念描述了社会如何维持凝聚力和稳定性，而韦伯关于合理化和官僚化的思想解释了现代机构如何高效运作。帕森斯将这些理论融入自己的框架中，强调社会机构之间的相互依赖以及它们共同对社会稳定性做出的贡献。

在帕森斯的时代背景下，家庭在加强传统价值观和角色方面发挥着关键作用，这些被认为是维护战后美国经济和社会秩序所必需的。然而，这一观点遭到了随后的女权主义思潮和家庭结构与动态变化的挑战。今天，家庭形式的多样性以及性别角色的流动性被认识到比帕森斯所提出的严格模式更加复杂和多面。

Talcott Parsons, an influential American sociologist, is known for his structural functionalism approach to understanding societies. He viewed families as essential "factories" for producing human personalities, with a significant role in socializing individuals according to societal norms and expectations. This socialization process prepares members for their future roles in society, including those in the workforce and other social institutions.

Parsons argued that the modern nuclear family structure, which emerged prominently in the mid-20th century in America, was particularly effective at this task because it allowed for a clear division of labor between the sexes. The nuclear family, consisting of a married couple and their children living independently from other relatives, was seen as a more efficient unit for socialization and fulfilling societal functions compared to larger, extended family units.

During World War II, the traditional gender roles within the family and society were disrupted when many women took on jobs in the workforce, demonstrating their capability to perform tasks traditionally reserved for men. Despite this, Parsons and other non-feminist scholars often maintained the view that there was a natural and necessary division of labor based on gender, where men were expected to be the primary breadwinners and women were primarily responsible for domestic duties and child-rearing.

Parsons' perspective on the family as a social institution was heavily influenced by the work of Émile Durkheim and Max Weber. Durkheim's concept of "mechanical" and "organic" solidarity described how societies maintain cohesion and stability, while Weber's ideas about rationalization and bureaucracy explained how modern institutions operate efficiently. Parsons integrated these theories into his own framework, emphasizing the interdependence of social institutions and their collective contribution to societal stability.

In the context of Parsons' time, the family played a critical role in reinforcing traditional values and roles, which were seen as necessary for the maintenance of the economic and social order of post-war America. However, this perspective has been challenged by subsequent waves of feminist thought and changes in family structures and dynamics over the past decades. Today, the diversity of family forms and the fluidity of gender roles are recognized as more complex and multifaceted than the rigid model Parsons proposed.
